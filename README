# SNAP.NET
Tool to assist with window mgmt, especially for users with more than one monitor.
Project abandoned, since MS PowerToys / Win11 cover my needs already.

Minimize / Maximize Tool with CTRL + Space. Current window in focus will be displayed. Select grid cells with mouse to select area on corresponding monitor to clip focussed window to selected area. CTRL + SHIFT + Space will exit the application. 
Note that a settings file will be created in AppData\Roaming\SnapNET.
